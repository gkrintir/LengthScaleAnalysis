## RECIPES FOR ATLAS-STYLE LENGTH SCALE CALIBRATION (LSC) 

$ Use the script lengthscale_analysis_step1_modified.py for STEP-1 (the script is updated wrt the old script lengthscale_analysis_step1.py).

$ For STEP-2, use lengthscale_analysis_step2.py 

N.B: Please remember that Orbit Drifts are not included in master branch. For systematic uncertainty calculation due to orbit drifts, please use the branch "LSC_w_Orbit_Drift".
